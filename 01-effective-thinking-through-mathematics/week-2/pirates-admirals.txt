Prompt: Please join in a discussion of the Pirates and Admirals puzzle!

Do not just give us the answer - instead, talk to us about how you are thinking about the problem.

-What techniques did you use?
-Where did you get stuck?
-What interesting observations did you make?

Response: 

- I kept track of all relevant information using a simple step diagram: location of pirates, admirals and boat on either side of the river. A few branches on this diagram eventually generated a solution. 

- I got stuck trying to apply the logic of the problem to arrive at a general solution. In this case, it was more helpful to simply run through a step diagram via trial and error. 

- At first I was keeping track of individual admirals and pirates via subscripts (i.e. A1, A2, A3). Eventually I realized this was unnecessary information. In solving future problems Iâ€™d try to boil the information down to the most atomic form possible.
